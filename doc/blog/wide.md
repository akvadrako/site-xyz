Treehouse needed a logo on their façade, something to declare their identity to the world. I was drawn to the idea of painting high up on a cherry picker. It seemed like a story one would casually mention to impress people. Otto and I made a surprisingly good team, even though our conversations were in Dutch, and I have the vocabulary of a 5-year-old. Somehow, we managed to communicate - I wouldn’t rule out telepathy. 

We worked for three days, swaying in the breeze, pretending not to be scared when I occasionally dropped things from a painful height. One of those things was a pencil sharpener, no bigger than a pea. Otto, with his uncanny knack for finding things, assured me he could track it down. I scoffed, naturally. But sure enough, he emerged triumphant with the sharpener in hand, leaving me speechless.

By the end of it, there was a logo—a proud symbol of our efforts and a testament to my questionable life choices.
