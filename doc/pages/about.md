Bespoke Mural

Each mural I create is unique, adding a distinctive touch to any space. If you're looking to transform a room, get in touch, and we'll design something that creates the ideal atmosphere.

As a mural artist, my process is both creative and collaborative, ensuring that the final artwork aligns with my client's vision. Below is how I approach creating a mural.

## Process

1. Client Consultation: I start by talking with the client to understand their vision for the mural, including their ideas, preferences, and the mural's purpose. We’ll discuss things like the theme, colour scheme, and style. As an architect, I know how important lighting and room layout are, so I keep these in mind to ensure the mural fits perfectly in its space.
2. Concept Development: Using the insights from our consultation, I prepare initial ideas and concepts for the mural as sketches or digital renderings. I go over the design with the client and make any tweaks needed until they’re completely happy with the concept.
3. Transferring the Design: With the concept finalised, I moved on to transferring it onto the wall using freehand techniques or tools like a grid or projector for more complex designs.

   After the base layers are dry, I add detailed elements to bring the mural to life. I finalise the artwork, ensuring every detail is meticulously crafted to perfection.
4. Client Feedback: I then present the finished mural and share any care tips. I always welcome client feedback to ensure they're thrilled with the final result. My goal is to make sure every mural truly brings the client’s vision to life and enhances their space.
