## Judge a wall by its mural

For far too long walls have gone unnoticed, hidden behind paper and paint. This is causing huge problems in the wall rights community. But frankly, undecorated walls do not deserve rights. With a wall-to-wall transformation, you can shut up your bare wall.

    <i>We worked together to choose a classic woodblock painting that would fit well with my new built-in shelves, keeping in mind the open sections. Iulia's easy to work with and dedicated to doing a quality job. The result really brings life and creativity to the room.</i> â€” Devin, Amsterdam
